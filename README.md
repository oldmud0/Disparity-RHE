Disparity: Rise of the Half-Elf
===============================

An ambitious attempt at an RPG game in Java using Slick2D. Right now, the game isn't playable. There's a lot going on behind the scenes, including character creation and things like that.

We hope to expect new members that will help us with the game art and music (if we ever reach that stage, of course).
